# Scrabble-Game

Scrabble is a desktop application game that challenges players to unscramble words to match their correct spelling. The game presents the player with 10 scrambled words that they must unscramble using a text box. The player can click on the "Check" button to check their answer, and if it is correct, the word turns black and a message appears indicating that the answer is correct. If the answer is incorrect, the word turns red, and a message appears indicating that the answer is wrong.

The player can also click on the "Show Answer" button to reveal the unscrambled word. The game keeps track of the player's score, and they can see it at the end of the game. The player can also click on the "Back" button to return to the main menu or the "Instructions" button to view the game's instructions.
